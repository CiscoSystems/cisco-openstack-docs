====================

Documentation for Cisco Systems based Openstack deployments

We will be documenting:

1. PuppetLabs puppet based deployments (with Cobbler and eventually Razer)
2. Opscode chef based deployments (with Cobbler)
3. A platform based reference architecture for the infrastrucure (compute, storage, network)

Initially, we will be working with the OpenStack Essex release, and will add in additional projects and create a fork for Folsom as we get closer to a Folsum release.

Please try the instructions in the [OS_Simple](https://github.com/CiscoSystems/cisco-openstack-docs/blob/master/OS_Simple.md OS_Simple.md) doc.

Additional documentation on the two key puppet files are in [Cobbler Node](https://github.com/CiscoSystems/cisco-openstack-docs/blob/master/Cobbler-Node.md Cobbler-Node.md) and [Site](https://github.com/CiscoSystems/cisco-openstack-docs/blob/master/Site.md Site.md) files.
