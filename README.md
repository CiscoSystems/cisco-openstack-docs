====================

Documentation for Cisco Systems based Openstack deployments

We will be documenting:

1. PuppetLabs puppet based deployments (with Cobbler and eventually Razer)
2. Opscode chef based deployments (with Cobbler)
3. A platform based reference architecture for the infrastrucure (compute, storage, network)

Initially, we will be working with the OpenStack Essex release, and will add in additional projects and create a fork for Folsom as we get closer to a Folsum release.

Please try the instructions in the OS_Simple.md doc.

Note the preseed is in the examples subdirectory as well.
