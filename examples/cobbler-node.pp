# = Cobbler and Puppet for nodes
#
# == Example
#
# add this to your site.pp file:
# import "cobbler-node"
# in your site.pp file, add a node definition like:
# node 'cobbler.example.com' inherits cobbler-node { }
#

# A node definition for cobbler
# You will likely also want to change the IP addresses, domain name, and perhaps
# even the proxy address
# If you are not using UCS blades, don't worry about the org-EXAMPLE, and if you are
# and aren't using an organization domain, just leave the value as ""
# An example MD5 crypted password is ubuntu: $6$UfgWxrIv$k4KfzAEMqMg.fppmSOTd0usI4j6gfjs0962.JXsoJRWa5wMz8yQk4SfInn4.WZ3L/MCt5u.62tHDGB36EhiKF1
# which is used by the cobbler preseed file to set up the default admin user.
