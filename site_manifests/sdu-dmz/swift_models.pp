#
# Example file for building out a multi-node environment
#
# This example creates nodes of the following roles:
#   swift_storage - nodes that host storage servers
#   swift_proxy - nodes that serve as a swift proxy
#   swift_ringbuilder - nodes that are responsible for
#     rebalancing the rings
#
# This example assumes a few things:
#   * the multi-node scenario requires a puppetmaster
#   * it assumes that networking is correctly configured
#
# These nodes need to be brought up in a certain order
#
# 1. storage nodes
# 2. ringbuilder
# 3. run the storage nodes again (to synchronize the ring db)
#    TODO - the code for this has not been written yet...
# 4. run the proxy
# 5. test that everything works!!

# in vagrant
